The Central Karoo Community Network Project aims to establish a reliable, secure, and scalable network infrastructure for the rural Central Karoo district, located 417 km southeast of Cape Town.
## Our mission 
Our responsibility in the Central Karoo project is to design, construct, and maintain a network that provides improved internet access to homes, medical facilities, and government buildings throughout the district. We will install fast and dependable internet in roughly 3000 residences, three hospitals, and local government buildings.
